Lag and high latency are among the most frustrating problems for online gamers. When your actions donâ€™t register immediately or the game stutters, it can ruin your gameplay experience. One effective way to reduce lag is by using a proxy server designed to optimize your internet connection.

## What Causes Lag and High Latency in Online Games?
Lag happens when there is a delay between your input and the game serverâ€™s response. This delay, or latency, can be caused by several factors including a slow or unstable internet connection, network congestion, or a long physical distance between you and the game server. The further your data has to travel, the more likely youâ€™ll experience lag.

## How Proxies Optimize Your Connection to Reduce Latency  
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your gaming device and the game server. By routing your internet traffic through a proxy server closer to the game server or located on a faster, less congested network, your data travels a shorter and more efficient path. This reduces latency and can provide a more stable connection, resulting in less lag and smoother gameplay.  
Additionally, proxies can help bypass bandwidth throttling imposed by some internet service providers during peak usage times, allowing your gaming data to flow freely.

## Key Factors When Choosing a Proxy for Gaming  
Not all proxies are created equal when it comes to gaming. To effectively reduce lag, look for proxies that offer low latency, high-speed connections, and servers near popular game data centers. Residential proxies are often preferable because they use IP addresses assigned to real devices, making them less likely to be detected and blocked by game servers.
